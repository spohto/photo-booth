# photo-booth

HTML project that allows user to take pictures with device camera and manipulate them with different filters. Works in Chrome, Firefox and Opera.

For the filters to work you need to allow the experimental canvas properties. They are found at Chrome: chrome://flags, Firefox: about:config and Opera: about://flags.

Video uses getUserMedia() which needs an HTTPS address to work.
